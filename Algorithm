Algorithm of Postfix to infix 

  1. Push post fix notation to the PostfixStack reverse order 
    ( eg. push  - * F / E D + * C B A)
2. while there are no data at PostfixStack 
3.     read one symbol from the PostfixStack  
4.     if the symbol is an operand
5.       push it into the InfixStack  
6.     else 
7.       pop the top 2 values from the InfixStack 
8.       put the operator between two operand 
9.       Encapsulate the resulted string with parenthesis
10.    if there is only one value in the stack 
        That value in the stack is the desired Infix notation
